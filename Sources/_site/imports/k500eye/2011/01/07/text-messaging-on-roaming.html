If you find that your text messaging service (SMS) starts acting up when you are roaming, try the following:<br /><br />From the Main Menu, go to<br />Settings &gt; Connectivity &gt; Data Comm. &gt; SMS Access<br />and set it to Circuit Switched.<br /><br /><br />This should work for most Sony Phones. For other phones use your discretion!
