The only way to do this is to use a PC to download the installer(s) and copy them to the memory stick using a data cable or a card reader. Then start up the phone, and install the application using the File Manager. If a JAR file is transferred to the phone using bluetooth or IR, the phone begins installation as soon as transfer completes, and deletes the installer.<br /><br /><br />MobileRar<br />Location     : http://in.mobango.com/media_details/mobilerar/E0MNyVI58Ws%3D/#<br />Last Checked     : 26.6.09<br /><br />An amazing utility for uncompressing files on your phone.Unfortunately it is Russian but is still usable. When the apploication launches, it asks for a target file (Zip, RAR, 7Zip) which it then uncompresses in the same directory as the compressed archive.<br />Possible issues are the lack of an option to change interface language and no option to change location where files are extracted.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Periodic Table:<br />Location:    : http://www.getjar.com/products/492/periodicTable<br />Good portable periodic table for ready reference.<br /><br />Global Time:<br />A convenient world clock.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>
