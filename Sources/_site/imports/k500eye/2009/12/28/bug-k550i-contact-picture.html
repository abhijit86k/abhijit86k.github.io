I noticed a very weird bug in the k550i...<br /><a name='more'></a><br />Take a picture of someone in landscape mode. Now set it as a contact picture. No problem. Take a picture in portrait mode, however, and rotate it. Now set it as a contact picture. Doesn't work. Why? For some unknown reason, the contact picture is used in the portrait mode whenever the picture is of one of the native sizes of the camera- 2 MP, 1MP or VGA.<br /><br />The solution-<br />1. Take the photo of the person in landscape mode. If, however, you want to use an existing photo that is portrait mode then-<br />2. Rotate the photo on the phone first so it is the right way. Now zoom in one step and save- at original size for best quality. Use this cropped photo as the contact picture.<br /><br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_FZ3fldHbfVg/Sz4mKC7u5tI/AAAAAAAACjA/of4pfmWPtwg/s1600-h/SE_K550i_%28Nemo5576%29.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_FZ3fldHbfVg/Sz4mKC7u5tI/AAAAAAAACjA/of4pfmWPtwg/s200/SE_K550i_%28Nemo5576%29.jpg" /></a><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Picture from Wikimedia Commons</span>
