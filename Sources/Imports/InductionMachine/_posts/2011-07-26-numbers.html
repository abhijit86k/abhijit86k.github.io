<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Said Wanda this morning:<br /><br />"I have a box of telephone rings under my bed.&nbsp; Whenever I get lonely, I<br />open it up a little bit, and I get a phone call.&nbsp; One day I dropped the<br />box all over the floor.&nbsp; The phone wouldn't stop ringing.&nbsp; I had to get<br />it disconnected.&nbsp; So I got a new phone.&nbsp; I didn't have much money, so I<br />had to get an irregular.&nbsp; It doesn't have a five.&nbsp; I ran into a friend<br />of mine on the street the other day.&nbsp; He said why don't you give me a<br />call.&nbsp; I told him I can't call everybody I want to anymore, my phone<br />doesn't have a five.&nbsp; He asked how long had it been that way.&nbsp; I said I<br />didn't know -- my calendar doesn't have any sevens.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- Steven Wright "<br /><br /></div>
