<div style="text-align: left;"><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #351c75;">I remembered this passage from Douglas Adams' story "Young Zaphod Plays it Safe" in the Hitchhiker's series:</span><br /><div style="color: #741b47;"><br /></div></div><div style="color: #741b47; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Aorist rods were devices used in a now happily abandoned form of&nbsp; energy production. When the hunt for new sources of energy had at one&nbsp; point got particularly frantic, one bright young chap suddenly spotted&nbsp; that one place which had never used up all its available energy was -&nbsp; the past. And with the sudden rush of blood to the head that such&nbsp; insights tend to induce, he invented a way of mining it that very same&nbsp; night, and within a year huge tracts of the past were being drained of&nbsp; all their energy and simply wasting away. Those who claimed that the&nbsp; past should be left unspoilt were accused of indulging in an extremely&nbsp; expensive form of sentimentality. The past provided a very cheap,&nbsp; plentiful and clean source of energy, there could always be a few&nbsp; Natural Past Reserves set up if anyone wanted to pay for their upkeep,&nbsp; and as for the claim that draining the past impoverished the present,&nbsp; well, maybe it did, slightly, but the effects were immeasurable and you&nbsp; really had to keep a sense of proportion.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;It was only when it was realised that the present really was being&nbsp; impoverished, and that the reason for it was that those selfish&nbsp; plundering wastrel bastards up in the future were doing exactly the same&nbsp; thing, that everyone realised that every single aorist rod, and the&nbsp; terrible secret of how they were made would have to be utterly and&nbsp; forever destroyed. They claimed it was for the sake of their&nbsp; grandparents and grandchildren, but it was of course for the sake of&nbsp; their grandparent's grandchildren, and their grandchildren's&nbsp; grandparents.</span></span></div></div><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br /></span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;">22 April, Earth Day</span>
