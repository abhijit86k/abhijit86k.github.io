<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Seem to be running into a few corner cases today. Qgit is a really nice viewer for git repositories, but it would crash each time I attempted to open the settings dialog. After some hours of debugging I traced the problem to the presence of newlines in the branch description. Full details can be seen in the bug report on <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/qgit/+bug/1221748">launchpad.net</a></div>
