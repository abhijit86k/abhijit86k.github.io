<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Because, ..., it is so easy and it costs so little labour to write  down ten bushels of barley, or a hundred head of cattle, or ten fields  of spelt - <br /><a name='more'></a>and the thing that is written will come to seem like the real  thing, and so the writer and the scribe will come to despise the man  who ploughs the fields and reaps the barley and raises the cattle - but  all the same the fields and the cattle are <i>real</i> - they are not  just marks of inks on papyrus. And when all the records and all the  papyrus rolls are destroyed and the scribes are scattered, the men who  toil and reap will go on, and Egypt will still live.<br /><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">~<i>Death Comes As the End</i>, A.
