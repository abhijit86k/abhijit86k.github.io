<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><a href="http://www.hindu.com/2011/04/10/stories/2011041061780100.htm">Anna Hazare</a>&nbsp; undertook a fast unto death demanding that the government take concrete steps towards bringing in anti-corruption legislation. The internet, especially Twitter, Facebook and email is abuzz with people demanding an end to corruption - organising candle lighting, meetings, speeches etc.<br />This morning Anna Hazare has ended his fast after the government has begun consituting a committe for drafting the Lokpal&nbsp; Bill. The first steps in what one hopes is the right direction.<br /><br />Later the same evening, I am in Malleswaram market, desparately looking for a place to park my bicycle. I find a spot right under a big P, just as a tow-away van of the traffic police arrives. These chaps are notorious for taking away bikes parked even a millimeter outside the designated zones, so I hang around to see who is the victim. But there isn't one. Instead, the chaps in the truck&nbsp;unload one of the scooters they had picked up, and the owner, presumably, hands them what looks like a few hundred rupee notes. <br /><br />Who are we blaming for corruption again?<br />Looks like its back to life as usual...</div>
