<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><br />Dear Swami Vivekanand,<br /><br />I trust you remember me as a fellow-traveller in your voyage from Japan to Chicago [in 1893].  I very much recall at this moment your views on the growth of the ascetic spirit in India and the  duty, not of destroying, but of diverting it into useful channels.  I recall these ideas in connection with my scheme of a Research Institute for India, of which  you have doubtless heard or read.<br /><br /><a name='more'></a><br />It seems to me that no better use can be made of the ascetic  spirit than the establishment of monasteries or residential halls for men dominated by this  spirit, where they should live with ordinary decency and devote their lives to the cultivation of  sciences â€” natural and humanistic. I am of opinion that if such a crusade in favour of an  asceticism of this kind were undertaken by a competent leader, it would greatly help asceticism  in science, and the good name of our common country, and I know not who would make a more  fitting general of such a campaign [than] Vivekanand.<br /><br />So you think you would care to apply  yourself to the Mission of galvanizing into life our ancient traditions in this respect? Perhaps,  you had better begin with a fiery pamphlet rousing our people in this matter? I should  cheerfully repay all the expenses of publication.<br /><br /><div style="text-align: left;">With kind regards,</div><div style="text-align: center;">I am dear Swami&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </div><div style="text-align: right;">Yours faithfully  Jamsetji N. Tata&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: right;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: right;"><br /></div><div style="color: #351c75; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br /></span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #351c75; font-size: x-small;">This letter was written sometime before 1900, and I chanced upon it in an old archive. The Research Institute of India that J. N. Tata talks about, which he subsequently founded, is today the <a href="http://www.blogger.com/">Indian Institute of Science</a> situated at Bangalore.</span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div></div>
