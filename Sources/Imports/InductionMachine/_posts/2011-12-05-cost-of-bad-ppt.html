<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Excerpted and adapted from the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=UlDWRZ7IYqw" target="_blank">"TEDx talk by John Bohannon &amp; Black Label Movement"</a><br /><br /><div style="color: #20124d;">Bad powerpoint presentations are a serious threat to the global economy. </div><br /><a name='more'></a><br /><div style="color: #20124d;">Assume on average that each presentation lasts 30 minutes and has an audience of 4 people, whose salaries are, say Rs 10 Lakh per year. Lets say that 25% of all these presentations are a complete waste. That alone amounts to 721 Crores per day. And that is just the cost of the listeners' time. <br /><br />The powerpoint softens up the audience, distracts them with pretty pictures and irrelevant data. It allows the user to create the illuion of competence, an illusion of simplicity, and most importantly, the illusion of understanding.</div><div style="color: #20124d;"><br /></div><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size: xx-small;">*Numbers adapted to Indian currency. </span></div>
