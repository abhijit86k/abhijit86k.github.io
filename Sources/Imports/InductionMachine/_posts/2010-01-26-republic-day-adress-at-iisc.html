One line that I found especially memorable, is quoted below.<br /><br /><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">"..<span style="font-family: Times,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"> <i style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">(looking at the main building) </i></span>I have not known any academic institution celebrating national holidays in such historic, inspiring surroundings... Jamshed Tata, whose statue you see behind me, was a man who dreamt about the future of India... When you walk in front of this building you should take a moment to think about India's past, reflect about it's present and may be dream about it's future ..."</div><br />--Prof. Balaram, Republic Day Speech, Jan 26, 2010.
