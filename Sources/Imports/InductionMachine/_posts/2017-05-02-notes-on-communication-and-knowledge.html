<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">For centuries we have attempted communication "downward." This, however,<br />cannot work, no matter how hard and how intelligently we try. It cannot<br />work, first, because it focuses on what we want to say. It assumes, in<br />other words, that the emitter communicates.<br /><br />...unless the recipient "hears," communication has not taken place.<br />Information and communication are different. Communication has not taken<br />place unless the emitter is sure that the receiver understands what action<br />is to be taken as a result of, say, a conversation or a memo.<br /><br />- Peter Drucker<br /><br />Sadly, there is a villain in our story. The villain is a natural<br />psychological tendency that consistently confounds our ability to create<br />ideas using these principles. It's called the Curse of Knowledge. (We will<br />capitalize the phrase throughout the book to give it the drama we think it<br />deserves.)<br /><br />Tappers and Listeners<br /><br />In 1990, Elizabeth Newton earned a Ph.D. in psychology at Stanford by<br />studying a simple game in which she assigned people to one of two roles:<br />"tappers" or "listeners." Tappers received a list of twenty-five<br />well-known songs, such as "Happy Birthday to You" and "The Star-Spangled<br />Banner." Each tapper was asked to pick a song and tap out the rhythm to a<br />listener (by knocking on a table). The listener's job was to guess the<br />song, based on the rhythm being tapped. (By the way, this experiment is<br />fun to try at home if there's a good "listener" candidate nearby.)<br /><br />The listener's job in this game is quite difficult. Over the course of<br />Newton's experiment, 120 songs were tapped out. Listeners guessed only 2.5<br />percent of the songs: 3 out of 120.<br /><br />But here's what made the result worthy of a dissertation in psychology.<br />Before the listeners guessed the name of the song, Newton asked the<br />tappers to predict the odds that the listeners would guess correctly. They<br />predicted that the odds were 50 percent.<br /><br />The tappers got their message across 1 time in 40, but they thought they<br />were getting their message across 1 time in 2. Why?<br /><br />When a tapper taps, she is hearing the song in her head. Go ahead and try<br />it for yourself - tap out "The Star-Spangled Banner." It's impossible to<br />avoid hearing the tune in your head. Meanwhile, the listeners can't hear<br />that tune - all they can hear is a bunch of disconnected taps, like a kind<br />of bizarre Morse Code.<br /><br />In the experiment, tappers are flabbergasted at how hard the listeners<br />seem to be working to pick up the tune. Isn't the song obvious? The<br />tappers' expressions, when a listener guesses "Happy Birthday to You" for<br />"The Star-Spangled Banner," are priceless: How could you be so stupid?<br /><br />It's hard to be a tapper. The problem is that tappers have been given<br />knowledge (the song title) that makes it impossible for them to imagine<br />what it's like to lack that knowledge. When they're tapping, they can't<br />imagine what it's like for the listeners to hear isolated taps rather than<br />a song. This is the Curse of Knowledge. Once we know something, we find it<br />hard to imagine what it was like not to know it. Our knowledge has<br />"cursed" us. And it becomes difficult for us to share our knowledge with<br />others, because we can't readily re-create our listeners' state of mind.<br /><br />The tapper/listener experiment is reenacted every day across the world.<br />The tappers and listeners are CEOs and frontline employees, teachers and<br />students, politicians and voters, marketers and customers, writers and<br />readers. All of these groups rely on ongoing communication, but, like the<br />tappers and listeners, they suffer from enormous information imbalances.<br />When a CEO discusses "unlocking shareholder value," there is a tune<br />playing in her head that the employees can't hear.<br /><br />It's a hard problem to avoid - a CEO might have thirty years of daily<br />immersion in the logic and conventions of business. Reversing the process<br />is as impossible as un-ringing a bell. You can't unlearn what you already<br />know. There are, in fact, only two ways to beat the Curse of Knowledge<br />reliably. The first is not to learn anything. The second is to take your<br />ideas and transform them.<br /><br />This book will teach you how to transform your ideas to beat the Curse of<br />Knowledge. The six principles presented earlier are your best weapons.<br />They can be used as a kind of checklist. Let's take the CEO who announces<br />to her staff that they must strive to "maximize shareholder value."<br /><br />Is this idea simple? Yes, in the sense that it's short, but it lacks the<br />useful simplicity of a proverb. Is it unexpected? No. Concrete? Not at<br />all. Credible? Only in the sense that it's coming from the mouth of the<br />CEO. Emotional? Urn, no. A story? No.<br /><br />Contrast the "maximize shareholder value" idea with John F. Kennedy's<br />famous 1961 call to "put a man on the moon and return him safely by the<br />end of the decade." Simple? Yes. Unexpected? Yes. Concrete? Amazingly so.<br />Credible? The goal seemed like science fiction, but the source was<br />credible. Emotional? Yes. Story? In miniature.<br /><br />Had John F. Kennedy been a CEO, he would have said, "Our mission is to<br />become the international leader in the space industry through maximum<br />team-centered innovation and strategically targeted aerospace<br />initiatives." Fortunately, JFK was more intuitive than a modern-day CEO;<br />he knew that opaque, abstract missions don't captivate and inspire people.<br />The moon mission was a classic case of a communicator's dodging the Curse<br />of Knowledge. It was a brilliant and beautiful idea - a single idea that<br />motivated the actions of millions of people for a decade.<br /><br />- Chip &amp; Dan Heath, Made to Stick</div>
