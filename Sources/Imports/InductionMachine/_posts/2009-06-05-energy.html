<span style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(204, 204, 204);font-size:85%;" >The following was a piece I wrote as an assignment for a course on (Alternate) Energy Systems. The objective was to attempt to address some of the issues related to the energy crisis the world is facing today.</span><br /><br /><br />Do we need to save the earth? Why? And <span style="font-weight: bold;">can</span> we save the Earth?<br /><br />People resist change. Humans adapt to their surroundings and the conditions around them and<br />hate it when something upsets them from this settled state. The only reason people embrace change is to prevent some larger change in some other way. So the motive force that causes the changeis the fear of a larger change. This explains why want to limit climate change today. We are afraid that we will get wiped out if we do not undo the damage we have done. But will CTRL-z work, if at all it can be done?<br /><br />We cannot be really sure that the climate and other physical changes that we are seeing today are indeed induced by human activity alone. For example, the ice ages have been periods in history where major climatic changes took place. The last ice age ended ended about 200,000 years ago. Nobody caused the ice age. They were a part of a cyclic change in the earth's geophysical cycle. As a result, it may not be unreasonable to believe that the current climatic changes we are seeing today are a part of some such slow geological cycle. Such processes are extremely hard to interpret and predict. For example, who would believe that the Saudi peninsula and the Indian peninsula are moving closer?<br /><br />The current climate change may be caused solely by the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. If this is the case, then it is of interest to recall a theory that suggests that the first living species on the planet were simple unicellular species capable of photosynthesis. The why is obvious. There was enough sunlight for such `plant-like' species to make their own food from the sea of nutrient material around them. These species thrived and resulted in a situation where the atmospheric oxygen content spiked up. This period marks the time when most of the early oxygen breathing species came into existence because oxygen was abundant. This could mean that the current atmospheric content is a precursor another boom of plant species. Some might say that the atmosphere is getting more and more toxic, and that gases like SO<span style="font-size:78%;">2</span>  and NO<span style="font-size:78%;">X</span> would not make for a hospitable atmosphere. However, as an example, there are known species of bacteria living in subterranean caverns that derive energy by processing concentrated sulfuric acid; so nothing is really impossible.<br /><br />That we are, at least in part responsible for our environment going downhill, and dangerously fast, is fairly well established. One question is, if humans had remained a hunting-gathering species, would the situation be any different? The Dinosaurs "Ruled the Earth'' before they got wiped out.  They did not burn fossil fuels (no pun intended), or drive SUVs on 8-lane concrete expressways. If the cause for their demise was the fact that they were an out of control alpha species, then if, instead of humans, another species had emerged as the 'alpha species', perhaps a similar result would have unfolded. This would mean that the human race will eventually get wiped out. Just how long it would take is really irrelevant, because we can, as a species, never properly comprehend any time frame longer than a century. If anything, we have only accelerated our journey towards our doom, and we are now desperately looking for the emergency brake.<br /><br />So let us be optimistic, do the best we can and hope everything works out fine (whether for us or for the rest of the Earth will be the subject for another discussion). What needs to be done to reverse the damage to the environment? Consider one specific case  - environmental pollution, and tackle the sources and remedies for the same. Most pollution is because we emit into our environment substances that are not naturally consumed by other species or natural processes. Non-biodegradable wastes such as plastics and heavy metals are sources of immense concern. The deadly effects of heavy metals entering the food chain became evident in the Minamata epidemic in the 1950s. We would want to prevent this sort of pollution (only) because it can come back and bite us when we least expect it. Change, driven by fear.<br />The bottom line is, therefore, anything that must be isolated from the environment must be processed and recycled. For instance, old batteries that contain heavy metals must be recycled. There is adequate initiative to recycle used batteries because we have been bitten by heavy metal toxicity once. What about the case of electronic waste? Electronic wastes comprise parts of electronic goods that can not be re-used or repaired. Electronic waste contains a deadly cocktail of heavy metals, toxic chemicals and plastic parts. Due to the way electronic products are manufactured and designed, it is difficult to isolate these components for separate processing. A lot of the time electronic waste from `developed nations' ends up, via legal, semi legal and illegal routes, in developing nations, where it scrapped and precious metals extracted. A related case of such `Toxic colonialism' is the French aircraft carrier Clemenceau which nearly ended up in the ship breaking yard at Alang; despite the Basel Convention being in force.<br />As a result, it would seem that a strong legislation would be the answer. If the government decides that it will pay for recycling and re-processing of hazardous waste, and recover the taxes through excise. The most fair way to do this would be to charge a tax on the sale of the product that will need to be recycled. For example, say a lead acid battery costs $1000 to manufacture, and a total of $150 to recycle. The government should charge a flat $150 tax on the sale of every such battery, and use it to fund recycling process. The manufacturer would pass on this cost to the final consumer. This would cause the consumer to see the true, effective cost of the product, and nobody loses. Except, of course, the battery manufacturer. As a consequence of the surcharge, the consumer now thinks more before making a purchase. Demands slump, and profits go south. That is why no such law is in force.<br />If such a law would have to come into force, it would have to have some benefit for the manufacturers, and at the same time have no evident threat to the populace at large.<br /><br />A large number of auto makers are promoting research into fuel cell vehicles, electric vehicles and alternate fuels, such as bio diesel and ethanol. They are surely not making any profit at all out of all this research as yet, except what little brownie points they may earn from the advertising and PR boost. It is because we are certain that we are going to run out of petrol. Maybe not for another 20 years, maybe not for 50 years, but the oil wells will surely dry up some day. And when that happens, the market for today's cars will disappear. At this point, the auto industry wants to be ready with their lineup for an entirely new, fertile market. As a small digression here, let us assume that we can somehow convert most of our vehicles to electric power. All these vehicles would need batteries with their heavy metal strings attached, so it might turn out to be a worse idea than to burn petrol and dirty the air. The best solution might be no cars at all, but then where will the auto makers go?<br /><br /><br />So then the question is what <span style="font-style: italic;">is</span> the best solution? Cars burning petrol? Electric cars with toxic leaded batteries? Or no cars? Let us analyze the problem at a slightly more abstract level to evaluate the various solutions to any given problem. Consider that a mass M is to be moved from one point (A) to another point (B). The total energy expended in doing this is dependent both on the relative locations of A and B (Potential differences), the path we choose to take (losses due to friction, etc) and the method we use to do the job. For example, one may move the mass manually by pushing or pulling, or drag it using a tractor, or use an electric winch, etc. In each case the work done remains the same, the losses may vary slightly. But the time taken to complete the task and amount of energy invested required changes greatly. To elaborate on this, the energy investment refers to the total amount of energy that is required to set up (a) system(s) of devices that allow the task to be done. For example if a tractor is used, then the invested energy includes the (energy) cost of mining metal from the earth, processing it, making a tractor out of it; of extracting crude oil from the earth, processing it, and getting the tractor and the fuel to the site of the work. Of course many of these costs are shared by a large number of operations, in addition there are many hidden energy costs that evade casual analysis. So it would seem that if at all we can find out what is the total energy requirement requirement for a certain task, all that remains to be done is to calculate the various efficiencies and energy investments required for the various schemes and pick out the winner.<br />Now, the earth system is closed with respect to mass transfer; i.e. mass neither leaves nor enters the Earth system*. The Earth system is not closed with respect to energy however. The only source of energy for the earth is solar radiation. Some of this radiation is absorbed and the rest is reflected. Some of this energy gets stored in the various geophysical mechanisms. If the total energy consumption exceeds this amount, we may simply run out of energy. For those who may feel skeptical about this, imagine the Earth system as a bucket. The input to the bucket is the incoming solar radiation. Our consumption rate can[?] be controlled by us. The bucket is quite large, but that does not mean it can be emptied. But as per the first law of thermodynamics, energy is neither created nor destroyed. So it really shouldn't matter how much energy is consumed, it all gets converted to some other form. So the bucket can never be emptied, right? Wrong. The bucket in this metaphor contains <span style="font-style: italic;">usable</span> energy. Which brings us to the second Law of thermodynamics, which, put succinctly, states that the entropy of the Universe is always increasing. Should we be worried? So what if the entropy increases? And what is entropy?<br /><br />Simply put, entropy means randomness. The randomness in the Universe always increases. Systems tend to go from ordered states to disordered states, and never the other way. <span style="font-size:85%;"><span style="font-style: italic;">[That's a great excuse for why my desk is such a mess!]</span></span> For example, drop an ice cube in water. According to the first law of thermodynamics, it is equally valid for the ice to melt and result in a glass of cold water; or, for the water to take more heat from the ice, resulting in more, colder ice swimming in hot water. Of course, there is no doubt as to what will eventually happen. Or, consider a capacitor, which is charged up to a voltage. Assume that there is some means for charge to move around within the capacitor. Now the capacitor may absorb energy from the surroundings, and charge up further, or it may lose some charge and emit the resultant energy as heat. Naturally the former will never happen. The energy lost to the environment becomes unusable. This unusable energy constitutes  entropy. Since the entropy of the universe is bound to increase, it does not matter how we manage our energy conversions; for each conversion some energy is lost as entropy. This unusable energy is thermal in its native form, i.e. heat. Mechanical friction, electrical resistive loss, and the heat of chemical reactions are all examples of energy loss to entropy. Therefore what empties the metaphorical energy bucket is loss to entropy. Energy transformed from one form to another remains within the bucket. So we need to minimise the entropy rate, not the energy rate. With this perspective, let us reconsider the task of moving the mass from point A to point B. Let us assume that the loss due to friction is roughly proportional to the velocity. Also assume that we have to complete the task within a certain time frame. So there's some minimum velocity to achieve, and some minimum frictional loss involved. Depending on the method we use to do the task, the entropy rate varies. For example, how much entropy is generated by the tractor? How much due to a single person manually doing the job? In general, all combustive energy sources generate a large proportion of entropy. Conversion of heat to any form of energy, especially mechanical, is highly entropy generating. In fact, the more concentrated an energy source, the more it will lose to entropy.<br /><br />Keeping the above discussion in the background, what could be the solution to a specific problem, for instance, the traffic problem in Bangalore? First of all, why do we need to solve this problem? Transport, and in particular, Urban transport is one of the most energy intensive of all human activities. In addition, it is fairly predictable due to traffic being dictated by well established routines, such as the periodic surge of people heading for work in the mornings and back in the evenings. Urban residents generally head to some recreational locations for the weekends or holidays. Some of this movement is fairly periodic, but some is highly unpredictable both temporally and spatially. The first question that need an answer is whether anyone actually needs to travel. For instance, if an employer could make jobs workable from home, then that many employees no longer need to commute. Some jobs may inherently require professionals on the site of the task, for example in hospitals, or where other immovable resources are involved. In such cases, the employer may be able to provide for accomodation of the employees in the vicinity of the workplace. However, the real question is this - What will make people opt for these alternatives? Why will they accept these changes? Going by the fundamental dictum, people accept change only to avoid a bigger change in some other change. Which means that transport should become more difficult or expensive or painful. The easiest way for this to happen is for petroleum to run out as soon as possible. This will force the entire community to experience extremely high monetary cost of travel. One model to emulate is that of the Singapore Transport Department's ERP - Electronic Road Pricing. The system comprises of fixed wireless hardware at various points in the island nation, and each vehicle is required to be fitted with a matching transponder which carries the vehicle identification data. The user is charged a `congestion tax' based on road usage. The rates depend on the locations, times and days of the week. For example, the central parts of the city have the most expensive tax, weekdays are charged the most, saturdays half rate, and sundays have only a fraction; and off peak times (10PM to 7AM) are tax-free. In addition, the rates also depend on the kind of vehicle in use. In fact, the cost of owning a car for a year is comparable to the purchase price. The scheme works because the government provides a cheap alternative in the form of dependable and convenient public transport, which is funded by the revenue earned with the ERP system. In New Delhi, for example, the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) has completed approximately 100km of track till date, resulting in a reduction of an estimated 50,000 cars from the roads. From the entropy point of view, there are two top solutions to the transportation problem. One is mass transport, and the other is human powered transport. The first is extremely attractive. As a larger number of people begin using it, the efficiency becomes higher. Note that the larger the number of people using the system, better the efficiency. The second part of the solution is human power. Humans are perfectly capable of propelling themselves over reasonable distances, and this would become an attractive alternative to expensive private transport and more expensive home exercise equipment. This would reduce the current dependence on combustive fuels for power. Non combustive sources such as solar, tidal, and hydel could be used for generating the power to drive the mass transport systems. The possibilities are endless. What will really matter in the end is whether we implement the necessary systems before or after they cease to be `alternatives'.<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size:85%;">*{For the moment neglect the debris from space that enters the earth, and the mass that we send out in the form of spacecraft and satellites.}</span>
