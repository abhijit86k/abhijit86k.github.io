<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">TexStudio had an annoying habit of jumping to the the previous brace when I wanted to go one word (CTRL + left / right). This is because this key combination is assigned by default to "Next (or prev) word / placeholder".<br /><br />Fix:<br />Assign nothing to "Next word / placeholder".<br />Assign CTRL+Right to "Move cursor right (1 word)" <br />Assign a different combination, e.g. Meta+Shift+Right to "Next placeholder".<br />Repeat for left.<br /><br />PS<br />Meta = Usu key with the windows logo.<br />On GNOME the "windows" / meta key is used in lots of shortcuts, so assign carefully.</div>
