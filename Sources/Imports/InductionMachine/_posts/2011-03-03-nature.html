<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Nature is not kind;<br />It treats all things impartially.<br />The Sage is not kind,<br />And treats all people impartially.<br />Nature is like a bellows,<br />Empty, yet never ceasing its supply.<br />The more it moves, the more it yields;<br />So the sage draws upon experience<br />And cannot be exhausted.<br /><br />-- Lao Tse, "Tao Te Ching"</div>
