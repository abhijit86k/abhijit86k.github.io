I saw a <span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: small;">few </span>Marco Polos some time ago<span id="ctl00_ContentPlaceHolder1_lblDetailNews1" style="font-family: inherit; font-size: small;"><a href="http://draft.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=2880836941511398370&amp;postID=2751527649343750956#bmtc-marco-polo-route">*</a></span>, and then I saw this one today, so I did some digging, and found out some interesting facts....<br /><br /><a name='more'></a><br /><br />According to a news report in The Hindu, BMTC was running two of these buses as an experimental stage starting November 2008. (The buses were flagged off on Rajyotsava). Interestingly, the BMTP proposed a fare structure that seems much lower that that of the DTC. In March&nbsp; 2009, the plan for Marco Polos was shelved. It was reported that<br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_FZ3fldHbfVg/S21AMsT0GEI/AAAAAAAAFBc/PygLHJuQZ4c/s1600-h/DSC01461.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_FZ3fldHbfVg/S21AMsT0GEI/AAAAAAAAFBc/PygLHJuQZ4c/s400/DSC01461.jpg" alt="Marco Polo Bus near IISc Bangalore" width="300" /></a><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;"><i style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">...a<span id="ctl00_ContentPlaceHolder1_lblDetailNews1"> senior official at BMTC said: “TM buses are not good value for money. TM buses are only Rs 10 lakh cheaper than Vajra buses while the life of a TM bus is shorter than that of a Vajra. Moreover, operational costs of the TM buses are very high and these buses are noisier than Vajra buses. Riding comfort for a passenger is also low.” “Moreover, the BMTC is not happy with the feedback from the public on the two buses put on trial-run. Our commuters are not very happy with TM buses,” the officer added.He also said that operating two types of fleet (Volvo and TM) would create operational problems for the BMTC.

For Marco Polo buses, DTC paid 60 Lakhs per bus in 2009. BMTC released figures in 2009 saying that Marco Polo buses cost 69Lakhs, and the Volvos cost 78 Lakhs. According to the BMTC report, the Marco Polos were almost as expensive as the Volvos and not anywhere as good. So BMTC decided to stick with the Volvos.<br /></span><br /><span id="ctl00_ContentPlaceHolder1_lblDetailNews1" style="font-family: inherit; font-size: small;"> <br /></span><br /><span id="ctl00_ContentPlaceHolder1_lblDetailNews1" style="font-family: inherit; font-size: small;">Incidentally, a number of DTC's Marco Polos have had operational trouble - with as many as 9 fires in the new low floor buses till date.In fact Tata motors was fined Rs 4Cr.
