<div style="color: #444444;"><span style="font-size: small;">Although the following in from the Wikipedia page for the K800, i find that the instructions for accessing the Sony Service Menu work on most recent phones, including the K550i. </span></div><div style="color: #444444;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br /></span></div><div style="color: #444444;"><span style="font-size: small;">Quoted from Wikipedia:</span></div><div style="color: #444444;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br /></span></div><div style="color: #444444; font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">The following tricks work on most Sony Ericsson phones as well as on K800. The service menu is available using the standard code implemented on several generations of non-Walkman Sony Ericsson phones: <b>right,&nbsp;*,&nbsp;left,&nbsp;left,&nbsp;*,&nbsp;left,&nbsp;*</b> from the standby screen. The service menu offers information on configuration and software versions in addition to offering functionality tests and some settings.<br />In the service menu there is also a hidden text. Go to the Service info/Model info entry. It shows your model number (K800i).</span></div><div style="color: #444444; font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">On the service menu select Service Info&gt;Model Info,you will see a pop up with the phone model in it, while the model is on screen press the keys 2,4,6,8 in a sequence to see a message placed there by the developers.</span></div>
