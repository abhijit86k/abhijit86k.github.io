I am an electrical engineer by training, currently a <a href="http://iitdh.ac.in/~kabhijit" target="_blank">professor at IIT-DH</a> and based in Dharwad, Karnataka.

My day job involves teaching & research in Electrical Engineering with a focus on Power Electronics, typically for Renewable Energy and Electric Vehicles.

Outside of work I dabble in open-source software and hardware, photography, music, and bicycling. I also co-host the  <a href="http://opelex.net/podcast" target="_blank">Opelex Podcast</a>.
