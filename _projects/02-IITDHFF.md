#### IIT-DH Flora and Fauna
This is an effort to catalogue the flora and fauna of the IIT-Dharwad campus (WALMI Campus) that a few campus residents have taken up. Photos are posted three times a week on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/iitdhflorafauna/), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/pages/category/Environmental-Conservation-Organization/IITDH-Flora-and-Fauna-113679577040064/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/iitdhflorafauna).
