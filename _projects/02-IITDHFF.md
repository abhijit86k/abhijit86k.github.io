#### Dharwad Flora and Fauna
This began as an effort to catalogue the flora and fauna of the IIT-Dharwad campus (WALMI Campus) when I was staying on campus.
Now that I live in Dharwad city, I post photos taken in and around the Dharwad region. 
Photos are posted on a semi-regular schedule to [Twitter](https://twitter.com/DHFloraFauna) and
 [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/dharwad.florafauna/). (I recently changed both the account names/ handles).

I  no longer maintain the [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/pages/category/Environmental-Conservation-Organization/IITDH-Flora-and-Fauna-113679577040064/) page.
