#### Bashlets
A collection of many small but useful scriptlets designed for Ubuntu-like systems. The full source is available via [Github](https://github.com/abhijit86k/bashlets).

**ThinkScr:** A script to remap the PrintScr key to Menu / RightClick key

**Wayback Scriptlet:**
 A bookmarklet that allows you to save a webpage to the Wayback Machine / Internet Archive in one click.

**Colash:**
 A fancy colored bash prompt with Git annotations

**exifscub:**
 One-line script that uses exiftool to remove all EXIF information from image files; and (optionally) adds  your name/date copyright info instead.

**rotatevid:**
 A small script to rotate a video using avconv. Now that avconv has been replaced with ffmpeg in newer releases; this might not work out of the box.
 
 **cowfortune:**
Prints a witty fortune cookie with some nice ASCII Art. Can be used to generate welcome messages for shell / ssh / etc.
