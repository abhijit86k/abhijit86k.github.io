I have substantial numbers of books in my house and searching and managing them has been quite painful.
Worse - it has been even harder to keep track of books that I have borrowed from (or lent to) others.
I have recently started exploring a free web based "home" library tracker called [LIBIB](https://www.libib.com/).
The free tier is just about perfect for a home library with one user. The best part is that the data entry system
(which I imagined to be the most painful part of the process) is actually a breeze - there is an android app that allows
users to scan ISBN Bar Codes. I added about 100 books with about 10 minutes.
There are a few corner cases here - some bar codes don't scan (*very* rare); some ISBNs are unable to be looked up,
etc - but these can always be added manually. Even better is that the catalog can be shared/published in _literally_ one click.
