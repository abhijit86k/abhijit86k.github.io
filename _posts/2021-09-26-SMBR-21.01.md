I'd been planning to slowly get back into cycling regularly and work my way back up to riding brevet distances (at brevet speeds).
Populaires are a great stepping stone, but I've been so out of form that even a 50k populaire seemed iffy.
The next best ride format is of course the SMBR: the [Sunday Morning Breakfast Ride](https://groups.google.com/g/iiscbikersnetwork/c/pAj0fKldTRo/m/9lh8O8Mk02IJ?hl=en-US).

In normal times it would have been a group ride with breakfast, but due to Covid I had to be satisfied with a solo ride and parcel pickup. The total distance was about 16km - 8km each way - quite comfortable distance. Unfortunately the route was not really up the scenic standards of an IBN ride - being almost entirely along a major highway (or service roads). Fortunately the service roads (see photo) are quite good on this segment. I experienced the legendary headwinds of Belgaum highway - at times it was painful just maintaining 15km/h.

The ride was also a good test of a lot of other things - Fitbit only recorded a small part of the ride and that too without GPS; OSM recorded most of it but with gaps / crashes; I forgot to set up the cyclocomp correctly - all said good prep for an actual ride.
As for the food, I got some idli vada from a typical "Udupi hotel". Food is quite good; but service is terribly slow - I would hesitate to stop here on a time-sensitive brevet. I also had some Mangalore buns after a very long time.
